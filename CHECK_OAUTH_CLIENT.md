# Check Your Current OAuth Client Configuration

## Current Issue

The `client_secret is missing` error indicates that your OAuth client is configured as a "confidential client" that requires a client secret, but we're trying to use PKCE (which doesn't need a client secret).

## How to Check Your Current OAuth Client

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `to-do-list-2b175`
3. **Navigate to**: APIs & Services > Credentials
4. **Find your OAuth client**: Look for the one ending in `...apps.googleusercontent.com`
5. **Click on it to view details**

## What to Look For

### If you see a "Client secret" field with a value:

- Your client is configured as a "confidential client"
- **Solution**: Either use the client secret in the code, OR create a new "public client"

### If you see an empty "Client secret" field:

- Your client should work with PKCE
- **Solution**: The issue might be elsewhere

## Quick Fix Option 1: Use Client Secret

If your current client has a client secret, I can add it back to the code:

```dart
'client_secret': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE',
```

## Quick Fix Option 2: Create New PKCE Client

1. **Create new OAuth client**:

   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "SmartScheduler PKCE Client"
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2redirect`
   - **DO NOT** add a client secret

2. **Update the code** with the new Client ID

## Which Option Do You Prefer?

- **Option 1**: Use your existing client with its client secret
- **Option 2**: Create a new PKCE-compatible client (recommended)
